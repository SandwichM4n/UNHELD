🗺️ Enemy System Roadmap (v4)
Phase 1: The Foundation (The "Brain" & "Hand")

	[x] Step 1: File Setup (Renamed to EnemySwarmer.gd)

	[x] Step 2: The Core Brain (BaseEnemy.gd)

		Variables: hp, move_speed, knockback_resistance.

		Logic: Visual flash and physics knockback moved here for global use.

	[x] Step 3: The Universal Hand (DamageHandler.gd) * Action: Create a node that handles the Area2D signals.

		Logic: Calculates the 1–6 roll and finds the hit direction.

		Scalability: This node will be usable by any "attacker" in the game.

	[x] Step 4: Blade & Swarmer Refactor

		Blade: Remove combat logic; it just swings the DamageHandler.

		Swarmer: Clean up script to only handle movement (The "Skeleton").

Phase 2: Movement & Composition

	[x] Step 5: Movement Components (MeleeMovement.gd, RangedMovement.gd - later).

	[Skipped] Step 6: "The Handshake" (BaseEnemy stopping movement during hit-stun).

Phase 3: The Heavyweights

	[x] Step 7: The Juggernaut (HP = 18, Resist = 1.0).

	[Skip this shit for now] Step 8: The Shielder (Dot Product calculation for frontal blocks).

Phase 4: Polish & Scaling

	[ ] Step 9: Damage Numbers (Visualizing the rolls in world-space).
